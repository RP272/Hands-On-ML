# Red-Wine-Quality-Regression

Red wine quality estimation based on attributes such as acidity, sugar, pH and others. 

The dataset was created by University of California (UC Irvine) and is publicly available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data).

# Project goals

The main goal of this project is to create and evaluate the efficiency of a regression model, that will estimate the wine quality based on it's attributes. Inspired by the second chapter of _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ book by Aurélien Géron.
